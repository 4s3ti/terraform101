# Basic structure of terraform composition

* Run terraform init
* Does it work? something wrong? 
    * Try running `terraform validate`
* Does the formating look right? can it look better? 
    * Try running `terraform fmt`
* Runn `Terraform Apply`
* What happens if you change something? 
* Imaging that you are working with someone, what happens if you share the code and that person runs it? 
    * Run `terraform destroy`, and move to Next chapter, remote state
